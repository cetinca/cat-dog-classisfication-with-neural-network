title: Cats and Dogs Classification with Pre-trained Neural Network
language: English
summary: "<p>Deep neural networks require a large amount of data and computing power\
  \ to train them from scratch. Collecting and annotating the data is time-consuming\
  \ and expensive. Even with the right computer, it may take days and weeks to train\
  \ a deep-learning model with millions of data points. Big IT companies have trained\
  \ and optimized deep neural networks on these large datasets, and have made these\
  \ models available to everyone. You can use these pre-trained models as is or customize\
  \ them to a specific task with transfer learning. In this project, you will learn\
  \ how to use pre-trained models and transfer learning to circumvent the data and\
  \ compute resource challenges in training deep-learning models from scratch.</p><br/><br/>Learn\
